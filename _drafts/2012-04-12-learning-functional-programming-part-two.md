## Part Two: NO LOOP FOR YOU

Touch on previous article contents
Where did these concepts come from?
    Old guys years ago, doing LISP.
    Using the building blocks provided by LISP
    to create abstractions for common idioms

    -- segue into --
What do functional languages offer
    IMMUTABLE VARIABLES!!!!
    PURITY!!!! RECURSION!!!!

    Features: functional composition, currying,
    REFERENTIAL TRANSPARENCY, PURE VS IMPURE CODE,
    isolation of failure points.

How do they differ from OOP
    They abstract the *how*, rather than the *what*
    Emphasis on building small, reusable, generic
    functions that can be combined in different ways
    to build powerful, more complex logic.

So, why isn't everyone doing it?
    Steep learning curve, stuffy intellectuals.
    Offer helpful articles describing functional programming
    and its core concepts. mjd's perl book. Carmack's
    article.

    Why I love Haskell vs why I *ship* with Erlang.
    Share the best learning resources for each
        learnyouahaskell
        learnyousomeerlang, also purchased erlang book (!)
    Recommend sites like projecteuler for excercises--text follows this line--
