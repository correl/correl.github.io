      <description>Digging through Derek Feichtinger&amp;rsquo;s org-babel examples (which I came across via irreal.org), I found he had some great examples of displaying git-style graphs using graphviz. I thought it&amp;rsquo;d be a fun exercise to generate my own graphs based on his graphviz source using elisp, and point it at actual git repos.
Getting Started I started out with the goal of building a simple graph showing a mainline branch and a topic branch forked from it and eventually merged back in.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Emacs Org mode for nearly a year now. For a while I mostly just used it to take and organize notes, but over time I&amp;rsquo;ve discovered it&amp;rsquo;s an incredibly useful tool for managing projects and tasks, writing and publishing documents, keeping track of time and todo lists, and maintaining a journal.
Project Management Most of what I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Org mode for has been breaking down large projects at work into tasks and subtasks.</description>
