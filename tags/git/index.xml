      <title>Drawing Git Graphs with Graphviz and Org-Mode</title>

      <description>Digging through Derek Feichtinger&amp;rsquo;s org-babel examples (which I came across via irreal.org), I found he had some great examples of displaying git-style graphs using graphviz. I thought it&amp;rsquo;d be a fun exercise to generate my own graphs based on his graphviz source using elisp, and point it at actual git repos.&#xA;Getting Started I started out with the goal of building a simple graph showing a mainline branch and a topic branch forked from it and eventually merged back in.</description>

      <title>Keeping Files And Configuration In Sync</title>

      <description>I have a few computers I use on a daily basis, and I like to keep the same emacs and shell configuration on all of them, along with my org files and a handful of scripts. Since I&amp;rsquo;m sure other people have this problem as well, I&amp;rsquo;ll share what I&amp;rsquo;m doing so anyone can learn from (or criticise) my solutions.&#xA;Git for configuration and projects I&amp;rsquo;m a software developer, so keeping things in git just makes sense to me.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Emacs Org mode for nearly a year now. For a while I mostly just used it to take and organize notes, but over time I&amp;rsquo;ve discovered it&amp;rsquo;s an incredibly useful tool for managing projects and tasks, writing and publishing documents, keeping track of time and todo lists, and maintaining a journal.&#xA;Project Management Most of what I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Org mode for has been breaking down large projects at work into tasks and subtasks.</description>
