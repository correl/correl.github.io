      <description>Got my hands on Portal 2 and finished a run through the single player campaign. Was a lot of fun, the characters were bursting with humor and personality. Just like the first game, it was hard to stop playing. Unlike the first game, it&amp;rsquo;s got some length, so I stayed up late a couple nights with my eyes glued to the television. I already want to play through it again to find any little things I my tired eyes may have missed.</description>
