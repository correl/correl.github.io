      <description>Now that I&amp;rsquo;ve got a house again, I can really start playing with home automation projects a lot more. The first thing I plan to do is come up with something to monitor and automate the garage door, as I&amp;rsquo;ve already panicked from not remembering whether I&amp;rsquo;d closed it when leaving the house. It turned out I had closed it, but I can definitely do without that anxiety. What better way to remove that anxiety than by being able to remotely monitor and control the door!</description>
