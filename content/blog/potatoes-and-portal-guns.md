[<img src="/images/portal_2_logo-150x150.jpg" alt="Portal 2 Logo" title="Portal 2 Logo" width="150" height="150" style="float: right" />](/images/portal_2_logo.jpg) Got my hands on Portal 2 and finished a run through the single player campaign. Was a *lot* of fun, the characters were bursting with humor and personality. Just like the first game, it was hard to stop playing. *Unlike* the first game, it's got some length, so I stayed up late a couple nights with my eyes glued to the television. I already want to play through it again to find any little things I my tired eyes may have missed.

I'm itching to give co-op a try, so if you happen to have it on xbox or care to drop by, let me know.

**Update:** Played some co-op with Jen, had fun navigating puzzles together :)
